Pic a selfie one a day for life and see you changing!

This project is about a smartphone app that will let you pic photos of you or whatever you want and see them sequentially like a timelapse.
The app helps you to pick new photos showing the latest one below the new one in transparence.

Every photos are then stored locally and remotely.
Users can see the changing by tapping on "LIVE" button that will show photos sequentially.
The also can create a movie tapping on "STREAM". The movie is created server side and then
sent to the phone as a link/qrcode where to download.
